/*• Objects store collections of key-value pairs.

• Each key-value pair is a property—when a property is a function it is known as a method.

• An object literal is composed of comma-separated key-value pairs surrounded by curly braces.

• You can access, add or edit a property within an object by using dot notation or bracket notation.

• We can add methods to our object literals using key-value syntax with anonymous function expressions as values or by using the new ES6 method syntax.

• We can navigate complex, nested objects by chaining operators.

• Objects are mutable—we can change their properties even when they’re declared with const.

• Objects are passed by reference— when we make changes to an object passed into a function, those changes are permanent.

• We can iterate through objects using the For...in syntax.
