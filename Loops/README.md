**Loops**
A loop is a programming tool that repeats a set of instructions until a specified condition, called a stopping condition is reached. As a programmer, you’ll find that you rely on loops all the time! You’ll hear the generic term iterate when referring to loops; iterate simply means “to repeat”.

When we need to reuse a task in our code, we often bundle that action in a function. Similarly, when we see that a process has to repeat multiple times in a row, we write a loop. Loops allow us to create efficient code that automates processes to make scalable, manageable programs.

As illustrated in the diagram, loops iterate or repeat an action until a specific condition is met. When the condition is met, the loop stops and the computer moves on to the next part of the program.

• Loops perform repetitive actions so we don’t have to code that process manually every time.
• How to write for loops with an iterator variable that increments or decrements
• How to use a for loop to iterate through an array
• A nested for loop is a loop inside another loop
• while loops allow for different types of stopping conditions
• Stopping conditions are crucial for avoiding infinite loops.
• do...while loops run code at least once— only checking the stopping condition after the first execution
• The break keyword allows programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block
