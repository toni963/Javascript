'Remember, objects in JavaScript are containers that store data and functionality. In this lesson, we will build upon the fundamentals of creating objects and explore some advanced concepts.

So if there are no objections, let’s learn more about objects!

In this lesson we will cover these topics: 

• how to use the ```this``` keyword.
• conveying privacy in JavaScript methods.
• defining getters and setters in objects.
• creating factory functions.
• using destructuring techniques.`

```
const robot = {
  model: 'B-4MI',
  mobile: true,
  greeting() {
  	console.log(`I'm model ${this.model}, how may I be of service?`);
  }
}

const massProdRobot = (model, mobile) => {
  return {
    model,
    mobile,
    greeting() {
      console.log(`I'm model ${this.model}, how may I be of service?`);
    }
  }
}

const shinyNewRobot = massProdRobot('TrayHax', true)

const chargingStation = {
  _name: 'Electrons-R-Us',
  _robotCapacity: 120,
  _active: true,
  _chargingRooms: ['Low N Slow', 'Middle of the Road', 'In and Output'],

  set robotCapacity(newCapacity) {
    if (typeof newCapacity === 'number') {
      this._robotCapacity = newCapacity;
    } else {
      console.log(`Change ${newCapacity} to a number.`)
    }
  },
  get robotCapacity() {
    return this._robotCapacity;
  }
}
