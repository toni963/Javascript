• .forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.

• .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.

• .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.

• .findIndex() returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns -1 if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.

• .reduce() iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.

• All iterator methods take a callback function, which can be a pre-defined function, a function expression, or an arrow function.
