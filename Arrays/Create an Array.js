/* One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets []. Remember from the previous exercise, arrays can store any data type â€” we can have an array that holds all the same data types or an array that holds different data types.

We can also save an array to a variable. You may have noticed we did this in the previous exercise: */

let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];

console.log(newYearsResolutions);

// Output: [ 'Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle' ]
