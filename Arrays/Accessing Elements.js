// JavaScript source code
/* Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items using their index, which is similar to referencing an item in a list based on the itemâ€™s position.

Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the positions start counting from 0 rather than 1. Therefore, the first item in an array will be at position 0


You can also access individual characters in a string using bracket notation and the index. For instance, you can write: */

const hello = 'Hello World';
console.log(hello[6]);
// Output: W

// The console will display W since it is the character that is at index 6.


const famousSayings = ['Fortune favors the brave.', 'A joke is a very serious thing.', 'Where there is love there is life.'];

let listItem = famousSayings[0];

console.log(listItem);
console.log(famousSayings[2]);
console.log(famousSayings[3]);

/* Output: Fortune favors the brave.
Where there is love there is life.
