# **Scope**
An important idea in programming is scope. Scope defines where variables can be accessed or referenced. While some variables can be accessed from anywhere within a program, other variables may only be available in a specific context.

You can think of scope like the view of the night sky from your window. Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the stars. The stars are accessible globally. Meanwhile, if you live in a city, you may see the city skyline or the river. The skyline and river are only accessible locally in your city, but you can still see the stars that are available globally.


## Review: Scope

• Scope refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.
• Blocks are statements that exist within curly braces {}.
• Global scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
• Global variables are variables that exist within global scope.
• Block scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible only within the block they are defined.
• Local variables are variables that exist within block scope.
• Global namespace is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
• Scope pollution is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.
