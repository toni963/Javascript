Let’s review the following terms:

• Scope refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.
• Blocks are statements that exist within curly braces {}.
• Global scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
• Global variables are variables that exist within global scope.
• Block scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible only within the block they are defined.
• Local variables are variables that exist within block scope.
• Global namespace is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
• Scope pollution is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.
